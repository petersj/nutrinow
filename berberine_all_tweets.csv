F*ck Ozempic. 

If you want to torch fat, you must eat in a caloric deficit, get at least 1g of protein per pound of body weight, cut out processed foods, lift weights, do HIIT cardio, and take this stack:

1. Berberine (1g, split) — Berberine can help with weight loss and improve body composition by increasing metabolism and reducing fat storage. Berberine has also been shown to help regulate blood sugar levels by increasing insulin sensitivity

2. Alpha-lipoic acid (300mg, split) — ALA is a powerful antioxidant that acts on multiple fat loss pathways. It reduces the activity of AMPK, which can decrease feelings of hunger and increase the number of calories burned at rest. Lipoic acid also improves glucose and fat metabolism, so more of the sugars and fats you consume are used for energy instead of being stored as fat. Similar to berberine, ALA has been shown to lower blood sugar levels. In several studies, patients on a calorie-restricted diet who took ALA lost more weight than a calorie-restricted diet alone

3. ALCAR (2-4g) — Carnitine helps your mitochondria burn fat & create more energy. ALCAR pushes your metabolism toward fat-burning for energy, which can help reduce body fat

4. Nigella sativa (1 tbsp) — Black seed oil appears to promote weight loss & decrease body fat by controlling appetite, balancing blood glucose, balancing triglycerides, and ridding the body of toxins. BSO has been shown to perform as well or better than Metformin at lowering blood glucose, improving lipid profile & reducing inflammation",https://twitter.com/BowTiedVitamins/status/1696159231613841614

•Comes from *berberry*, a fruit native to Himalayas and Nepal
•Also called Daru Haldi or Tree turmeric
•Works by upregulating AMPKinase, just like metformin
•250 to 500 mg per day (package inserts say 1500 mg per day)
•❓Can be used in
◦Metformin allergy - possible 
◦Kidney failure - no data ⚠️
•Also has anticancer and anti ageing properties￼
•⚠️ Can inhibit CYP3A4 enzyme
•Nearly 10 times as expensive as metformin 
•Can reduce TG,LDL and BP too , but by how much is the question - not much.

So when you feel like using Berberine, why not go for the tried and tested Metformin instead ?",https://twitter.com/karthik2k2/status/1687063581874110464

The bad news is they definitely changed the formula so instead of being pure Berberine HCL like it used to be it's now half HCL and half Berberine phytosome. 

Specifically it appears they are doing their own version of an existing patented form of Berberine phytosome Berbevis®. Technically speaking this should improve absorption, however based on the reviews post change people seem to be experiencing worse effects.

The idea behind the pea/grape seed/sunflower blend (which I really wish they would make much more clear for their customers) is to take Berberine and reduce it's particle size, then making a sunflower lecithin emulsion encase it using pea protein and grape seed oil(supposedly it also helps reduce nausea) as a carrier to increase absorption/ watersolubility.  

Personally if I were to take a Phytosomal form I'd go with nootropics depot/ Enzymedica's Berberine as they are using the tested and patented form that has shown benefits. (It claims up to a 10x absorption improvement)

That sai,  I liked the previous formula and wish they kept it around. They still have a 200mg version with just Berberine but it's significantly less potent than the previous two versions they did away with.",https://twitter.com/SuppResearch/status/1683940858616315904

The bad news is they definitely changed the formula so instead of being pure Berberine HCL like it used to be it's now half HCL and half Berberine phytosome. 

Specifically it appears they are doing their own version of an existing patented form of Berberine phytosome Berbevis®. Technically speaking this should improve absorption, however based on the reviews post change people seem to be experiencing worse effects.

The idea behind the pea/grape seed/sunflower blend (which I really wish they would make much more clear for their customers) is to take Berberine and reduce it's particle size, then making a sunflower lecithin emulsion encase it using pea protein and grape seed oil(supposedly it also helps reduce nausea) as a carrier to increase absorption/ watersolubility.  

Personally if I were to take a Phytosomal form I'd go with nootropics depot/ Enzymedica's Berberine as they are using the tested and patented form that has shown benefits. (It claims up to a 10x absorption improvement)

That sai,  I liked the previous formula and wish they kept it around. They still have a 200mg version with just Berberine but it's significantly less potent than the previous two versions they did away with.",https://twitter.com/SuppResearch/status/1683940858616315904

We've seen TikTok trends come and go, but one that has caught our eye is the hype around berberine, a 'natural' alternative to the diabetes medication Ozempic. Before you jump on the bandwagon, let's get real about what these substances offer.

While small studies show berberine might help manage blood sugar and promote weight loss, remember: 'natural' doesn't guarantee 'safe' or 'effective'. Berberine comes with potential side effects and can interact with various medications, posing health risks.

Similarly, Ozempic, used for managing diabetes and weight loss, mimics a hormone that regulates appetite and insulin production. However, it doesn't solve the root causes of health issues and comes with risks.

Bottom line? These aren't magic bullets. At WellSource Integrative Health, we advocate for sustainable, personalized health strategies. Your health journey is a marathon, not a sprint, and we're here to guide you every step of the way.

If the Berberine or Ozempic hype has caught your attention, remember to seek health advice from qualified professionals, not viral trends. Be an informed consumer and consult your healthcare provider before starting any new treatment or supplement.

Stay informed and stay healthy!

The media has been going crazy to defend the pharmaceutical industry's profits in the past few days, and it is not about mRNA vaccines! It is about Ozempic diabetes drug that is being used for weight loss.

They are alarmed that the world is figuring out that Berberine does the same as this very expensive drug.

Berberine is a fairly inexpensive supplement of a common compound found in most plants.  And thus, they do not want the world to know that both berberine and Ozempic (semaglutide) work upon the provocation of over-expression of the GDF15 gene and the protein it expresses to reduce fat in the human body.

Here is the documented truth, contrary to what the bought and paid-for media have been going crazy over the past few days, and the very uncomfortable truth about what the fact-checkers are about to start falsely claiming. LOL

There’s a really good #supplements  called #berberine. Have you heard of it? However, if your body is performing well & your bloodwork is in a very good range don’t change a thing. 
Stay consistent with that. 

If you don’t mind. Helping me understand exactly what you did? 
*Did you train with weights?
*Were your meals prepared in line with your training schedule if you were training. 
*How much filtered water did you drink in a day?
*Are you sleeping through the night and not getting up. 
Are you using any #supplements 
This is why I ask, because most medicines are extremely harsh on the bodies organs. That’s where some side effects come from. 
If you were using a med that was toxic to your liver overtime, I would recommend milk thistle to protect that organ and you have 78 of them making up your 12 systems. In fact, I have 10 #supplements that are a must as a supplement expert. I know the companies who the labeling is completely accurate. I use them and all my clients and patience do as well.

 Metabolism Boost: Scientific evidence suggests that Berberine may enhance metabolic function, potentially leading to increased calorie expenditure and improved fat breakdown. It's like giving your metabolism a natural boost!

 Fat Accumulation Reduction: Studies indicate that Berberine has the potential to inhibit the formation and storage of fat cells, aiding in the reduction of adipose tissue. This could be particularly beneficial for those seeking to shed excess pounds.

 Appetite Regulation: Research suggests that Berberine may help regulate appetite, promoting feelings of fullness and reducing cravings. By supporting better control over food intake, it can contribute to healthier eating habits.

 Insulin Sensitivity Improvement: Berberine has been shown to enhance insulin sensitivity, which plays a crucial role in regulating blood sugar levels. By improving insulin function, it can potentially support weight management efforts. 

Consider incorporating Berberine into your weight management strategy, but always consult with your healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here's to a healthier, happier you!

I think that this layperson article about Berberine is pretty fair, but missing the boat. Although they point out that berberine has a lot of small beneficial effects in the body, like improvements in blood pressure, cholesterol & blood sugar,...

My fibroids were large, and are about 2/3 smaller now. Berberine is good for blood sugar levels and many other things. Serrapeptase breaks down the fibrin.

Berberine improves pancreatic beta cell function. And much more.

Which is crucial for insulin resistant individuals.

But why pick Dihydroberberine over regular Berberine.

- Lower GI stress
- Lower dose required 
- 5 times more bioavailable
- Stronger sugar lowering effects 

Also, it increases levels of BHB (BETA HYDROXYBUTYRATE) which means you get into a ketosis state much faster.

It also increases adiponectin (fat-derived hormone that plays a role in protecting against insulin resistance/diabetes)",https://twitter.com/DiegoGReyes08/status/1663180030019530753

-- by paul ybarra

Diabetes is a chronic health condition that has been documented in medical history for thousands of years. The earliest references to what we now call diabetes come from Ancient Egyptian manuscripts dating back to 1500 BC, describing a condition of excessive urination and weight loss. The term ""diabetes"" itself is credited to the Greek physician Aretaeus (81-138 AD), who used the word ""diabetes,"" meaning ""to pass through,"" to describe the excessive urination associated with the disease.

The differentiation between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes occurred much later, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when physicians began to understand that some diabetic patients were insulin-dependent (Type 1), while others were not (Type 2). The discovery and subsequent mass production of insulin in the early 20th century was a major breakthrough for the treatment of diabetes, particularly for Type 1 diabetes.

Berberine, a compound found in several plants including Barberry, Tree Turmeric, Goldenseal, and Oregon Grape, has been used in traditional medicine in various cultures for centuries, particularly in Ayurvedic (Indian) and Chinese medicine. Its applications in these traditional medicine systems include the treatment of gastrointestinal issues, infections, and various other health conditions.

Interest in the potential of berberine to aid in the treatment of diabetes has been more recent, largely occurring in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Scientific studies have suggested that berberine may have antihyperglycemic effects, meaning it could help to lower high blood sugar levels. This has led to interest in berberine as a potential natural supplement for managing Type 2 diabetes.

Research indicates that berberine may improve insulin sensitivity, reduce glucose production in the liver, and promote the uptake of glucose in cells. Berberine's mechanisms of action appear to be similar to those of metformin, a commonly prescribed drug for Type 2 diabetes.

However, while these initial findings are promising, more research is needed to confirm berberine's safety and efficacy for the treatment of diabetes. It's important for individuals to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement or treatment.",https://twitter.com/ybarrap/status/1661026531487932416

Artık Türk halkı, ruhban sınıfının gerçek dini yansıtmadığını çok iyi biliyor.

Yaklaşık bir yıl kadar önce bir mahalle berberine gittiğimde bi haber üzerine berberdeki dayıların bile bu ruhban sınıfının yaptığı terbiyesizliklerin, ahlaksızlıkların bir dinsizin bile yapmayacağını, ateistlerin bile bu ruhban sınıfına kıyasla daha ahlaklı olduğunu konuştuklarını duydum.

Ki bunu diyen adamlar da müslüman. İlk o zaman anladım artık halkın uyanmaya başladığını.

akp'nin ve ruhban sınıfının gerçek müslüman sayısının düşmesine pozitif etkisi var.

Dipnot: Sadece Türkiye'de müslümanlık için değil dünyanın heryerinde bütün dinler için ruhban sınıfının kendi kutsal kitabına, dinine zararlı olduğunu söylüyorum. İslam düşmanlığı falan yapmıyorum konuyu yanlış yerlere çekmeyin.

Bugün için müslümanlıktaki ruhban sınıfı ne ise orta çağ'da batı avrupadaki kilise de o'dur.

Neyseki hristiyan dünyası Martin Luther King'in öncülüğünde Katolik Kilisesi'ne ve Papa'nın otoritesine karşı girişilen reform hareketinin sayesinde kilisenin gücünden bizden erken kurtuldular.
Böylece protestanlık mezhebi doğdu yani papazlara ihtiyaç duymaksızın incil'i okuyabildikleri için her vaftiz edilmiş inananın aracı bulunmadan rahiplik yetkisi olduğuna inandılar.
Ki doğrusuda budur ve aslında hristiyan dünyası için olumlu gelişmedir.

İslam içinde ruhban sınıfını aradan kaldırsak insanlar analayacağı şekilde kuran'ı türkçe okuyup, dualarını türkçe etseler. kendi imanlarını kendi gerçekleştirseler her şey düzelecek şuan da hiç kimse anlamadığı şeyleri okuyor camiye gittiğinde anlamadığı şeyleri dinliyor.
Ve inanın aradan aracıları çıkarmış olsaydık son 20 yılda ki müslüman sayısındaki azalış bu kadar fazla olmazdı.

Luther gibi Atatürk'te cumhuriyetin ilanı ile aslında bir reform yapmıştır İslam dünyası için pozitiftir ama maalesef son 20 yılda ılımlı islam politikası ve siyasal islamcılar yüzünden tekrar ruhban sınıfı yükselişte bunun sonuçlarını da biliyorsunuz zaten.

Berberine is a chemical found in plants that has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine. 

Berberine’s benefits include:

• Lower blood sugar levels: Berberine has been shown to help regulate blood sugar levels by increasing insulin sensitivity.

• Reduce cholesterol: Berberine can help lower total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, which can reduce the risk of heart disease.

• Anti-inflammatory: Berberine has anti-inflammatory properties, which may help prevent chronic diseases.

• Improve gut health: Berberine can promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria and reduce harmful bacteria, which can improve digestive health and boost immunity.

• Weight loss: Berberine may help with weight loss and improve body composition by increasing metabolism and reducing fat storage.

• Enhance brain function: Berberine has been shown to have neuroprotective effects and may help improve cognitive function, including memory and learning.

• Hair growth: Some studies suggest that berberine may have a positive impact on hair growth by improving blood circulation to the hair follicles, reducing inflammation, promoting the growth of hair cells, and regulating hormone levels.

• Longevity: Like Metformin, Berberine has been shown to activate an enzyme called AMPK, which plays a key role in cellular energy metabolism and may help improve cellular health and reduce cellular damage. Boosting AMPK mediates inflammation and activates autophagy, which is beneficial for preventing many age-related diseases.",https://twitter.com/BowTiedVitamins/status/1643637152272601093

Berberine is a chemical found in plants that has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine. 

Berberine’s benefits include:

• Lower blood sugar levels: Berberine has been shown to help regulate blood sugar levels by increasing insulin sensitivity.

• Reduce cholesterol: Berberine can help lower total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, which can reduce the risk of heart disease.

• Anti-inflammatory: Berberine has anti-inflammatory properties, which may help prevent chronic diseases.

• Improve gut health: Berberine can promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria and reduce harmful bacteria, which can improve digestive health and boost immunity.

• Weight loss: Berberine may help with weight loss and improve body composition by increasing metabolism and reducing fat storage.

• Enhance brain function: Berberine has been shown to have neuroprotective effects and may help improve cognitive function, including memory and learning.

• Hair growth: Some studies suggest that berberine may have a positive impact on hair growth by improving blood circulation to the hair follicles, reducing inflammation, promoting the growth of hair cells, and regulating hormone levels.

• Longevity: Like Metformin, Berberine has been shown to activate an enzyme called AMPK, which plays a key role in cellular energy metabolism and may help improve cellular health and reduce cellular damage. Boosting AMPK mediates inflammation and activates autophagy, which is beneficial for preventing many age-related diseases.",https://twitter.com/BowTiedVitamins/status/1643637152272601093

Berberine’s benefits include:

• Lower blood sugar levels: Berberine has been shown to help regulate blood sugar levels by increasing insulin sensitivity.

• Reduce cholesterol: Berberine can help lower total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, which can reduce the risk of heart disease.

• Anti-inflammatory: Berberine has anti-inflammatory properties, which may help prevent chronic diseases.

• Improve gut health: Berberine can promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria and reduce harmful bacteria, which can improve digestive health and boost immunity.

• Weight loss: Berberine may help with weight loss and improve body composition by increasing metabolism and reducing fat storage.

• Enhance brain function: Berberine has been shown to have neuroprotective effects and may help improve cognitive function, including memory and learning.

• Hair growth: Some studies suggest that berberine may have a positive impact on hair growth by improving blood circulation to the hair follicles, reducing inflammation, promoting the growth of hair cells, and regulating hormone levels.

• Longevity: Berberine has been shown to activate an enzyme called AMPK, which plays a key role in cellular energy metabolism and may help improve cellular health and reduce cellular damage. Boosting AMPK mediates inflammation and activates autophagy, which is beneficial for preventing many age-related diseases.",https://twitter.com/BowTiedVitamins/status/1638178672975962114
